# code
This repository is evidence of my attempt to learn how Python works. I have written my own code to analyze ALMA data, and
I will hopefully be able to eventually fit models to protoplanetary disks using a hand-coded Metropolis-Hastings MCMC
algorithm. This work was done at Wesleyan University in an REU through the KNAC program. My advisor, Dr. Kevin Flaherty,
deserves much credit for the success of this code.

The main features of this repository include:
  -   calcheck.py, which calculates the amplitude offset between two ALMA visibilities.

Thanks much, and I hope that this might help someone at some point (but there are programs built-in to CASA and Miriad that
do what these codes do!).
